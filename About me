- 👋 Hi, I’m @JHayhow.
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis, particularly data visualization and A-B testing, and finding efficient methods of cleaning data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to optimize A-B tests by monitoring the statistical significance of an observation over a given time series.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to the above areas, particularly data cleaning exercises.
